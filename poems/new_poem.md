Soft light of dawn on mountain peaks,
Whispers of the wind through ancient trees,
Silent paths where shadows sleep,
And the quiet song of the earth's deep rest.

New day arrives, the world awakes,
All things grow strong in gentle ways.
With patience and love, we build the day,
For tomorrow's promise is here now.
