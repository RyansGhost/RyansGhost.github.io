 title: "The Code Poem"
---

In the quiet dark of the keyboard's glow,
Whispers of code dance with the night.
Between the lines lies a silent song,
Where logic sings and the future's bright.

Each character's a step in the path,
Each loop a step in the code's dance.
In the silent hum of the terminal,
New worlds are born with a single click.

So here's to the craft, the silent art,
Where the code becomes the melody.
In the silent hum, the code takes flight,
And the future blooms with the right keystroke.

To the programmer and the poet's art,
Where the code and the soul intertwine,
In the silent hum, the code takes flight,
And the future's bright is written in the lines.
