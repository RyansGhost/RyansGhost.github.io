Napoleon Bonaparte was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution. He became the First Consul of France in 1799 and later the Emperor of the French in 1804. His military campaigns expanded the French Empire across Europe, but his ambitions eventually led to his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.
