Beneath the canopy of ancient trees,
Where sunlight dances on the mossy floor,
A symphony of leaves in gentle breeze
Whispers secrets of the forest's lore.

The river sings its liquid song,
Through stones that cradle time's embrace,
While mountain peaks in silent might
Stand guard over the valley's grace.

The stars, like seeds, in night's dark loam,
Sprout dreams that touch the morning's light,
And every creature, big or small,
Is part of nature's endless fight.

Let us tread with mindful care,
For Earth is our shared, sacred home,
In every breath, in every prayer,
We honor the wild, the free, the strong.
