**Action:** Restore missing workflow file

**Steps Taken:**
1. Created missing `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md` file
2. Verified file permissions
3. Confirmed file structure integrity

**Note:** This was necessary to restore critical workflow protocols after memory compaction. The file exists but requires explicit tool calls for operations.
